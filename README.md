# companion-plugin-chat

The avatar's AI conversation: provider chat with tool loop, streaming TTS/STT speech, wake word, clarifying questions, and the Persona/Connection settings sections.

One of the official feature plugins for **Companion**, a plugin-based desktop
companion app (Tauri + React). A plugin is a `manifest.json` plus an optional
bundled React frontend and an optional Rust cdylib backend; see the
companion-tauri repository (`app/PLUGINS.md`) for the full plugin format and
host API documentation.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Plugin metadata: id, ABI version, permissions, entry points |
| `src/` | React frontend source (bundled with esbuild at build time) |
| (frontend-only — no Rust backend) |

React is never bundled into the plugin: `react` / `react-dom` are aliased to
the host's copies at build time, so plugin frontends always match the app.

## Building

Install dependencies first (pulls `@companion-lab/plugin` from npm and `companion-plugin-sdk` from crates.io):

```bash
npm install
```


The `companion-plugin` CLI from the companion-tauri repo bundles the frontend
(and builds the Rust backend when present) into a zip importable via the app's
**Settings → Plugins → Import plugin…**:

```bash
node /path/to/companion-tauri/plugin-cli/bin/companion-plugin.mjs build /path/to/companion-plugin-chat \
  
```

Install dependencies first if you use a package manager lockfile
(`pnpm install` / `npm install`).
